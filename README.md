OpenLogger
==========

The goal of OpenLogger is to provide a simple flight logging app that uses Androids GPS positioning
API and barometer to generate simple flight log files.

These flight logs will then be viewable in a separate desktop program that uses Google Maps API
to display the logged flight path.
